# Omarchy - Compact date/time format for Nautilus
# Uses custom en_US_compact locale with format: M/D/YY H.MMam/pm
# Note: This only affects graphical applications, not system tools

# Commented out to prevent locale warnings in system tools
# LC_TIME=en_US_compact.utf8
# LOCPATH=$HOME/.local/share/locale

# Instead, we'll set these only for Nautilus via .desktop file override
